# MyApplication
1. Created a Console App To read from Json.
2. Find the first and second maximum number in the array List
3. Remove subsequent duplicate number in the array.
4. An item is represented as an asterisk "*". A container is represented as a pair of pipes that may or may not have items between them "|"
Example 1:
Input: s = |**|*|*, startIndices = [1, 1], endIndices = [5, 6]
Output: [2, 3]
Explanation:
The string has a total of 2 closed container, one with 2 items and one with 1 item.
For the first pair of indices, (0, 4), the substring |**|*. There are 2 items in a container.
For the second pair of indices, (0, 6), the substring is |**|*|* and there are 2 + 1 = 3 items in container.
Both of the answers are returned in an array, [2, 3]
5. Merge Two Array Elements 
6. Reposition Array Elements based on old and new position in the array
7. String Is Palindrome
